## Compatibility

**This package is compatible with Node.js versions 10 through 20, as well as future versions.**

The syntax remains consistent with the earlier version 1.0.0; however, it's advisable to always use the latest version, as it offers numerous new features and enhancements.

## Installation

Install globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g audit-export
```

## Usage

The tool is packed with a help function to see the usage ways. To see it, just pass the `--help` option.

The simplest usage is as the following:

```
npm audit --json | audit-export
```

But with more customizations you can use it in two different main ways:

```
npm audit --json | audit-export --folder <folder_path> --file <file_name.html> --title <HTML_file_title>
```

or:

```
npm audit --json | audit-export <path> <file_name>
```

<sub><strong>All parameters are optional.</strong><br/>By default it will use <i>the current folder</i>, <i>"audit-report.html"</i> as file name, and <i>"NPM Audit Report"</i> as title.</sub>
